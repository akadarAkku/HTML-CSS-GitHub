<h1>What is the DuckDuckGo?</h1>
<p><strong>DuckDuckGo (DDG)</strong> is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' 
 privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of <em>personalized search results.</e> <strong>DuckDuckGo </strong>
distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by 
showing all users the same search results for a given search term,and emphasizes
 returning the best results, rather than the most results, generating those results 
 from over 400 individual sources, including crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia, 
 and other search engines like Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex.As of August 2019, it had 
 44,196,092 daily direct searches on average.</p>

<p>The company is based in Paoli, Pennsylvania, in Greater Philadelphia, 
and has 67 employees as of July 2019.The company name is a reference 
 to the children's <em>game duck, duck, goose.</em></p>
<br>

<p>Some of <strong>DuckDuckGo's</strong> source code is free software hosted
 at GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License,
 but the core is proprietary. The company registered the
  domain name ddg.gg on February 22, 2011,
  and acquired duck.com on December 12, 2018, which are used as shortened URL 
 aliases that redirect to <strong>duckduckgo.com.</strong> </p>
